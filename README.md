# Webscrapping-using-python
I scrapped some information from wikipedia using python and read the file directly into a csv
You can download the file to get the codes used
The scrapping was done using libraries like beautifulSoup and pandas was used for the dataframe creation and for reading the file into csv.
Enjoy!!
